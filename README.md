# navigation

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

This project is for Named Navigations in flutter.

I have created three screens to demonstrate named navigations.

I have implemented Navigator.pushNamed(), Navigator.pushReplacementNamed(), Navigator.pop() and static methods.

Implemented Arguments passing method.
